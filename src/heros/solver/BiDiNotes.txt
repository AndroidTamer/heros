TODOs:

- change initialSeeds() to return a mapping from Unit to Abstraction
- this then allows us to overwrite the initial seeds in the AugmentedTabulationProblem to include the seed unit


General principle:

We propagate configurations (abstraction, source) in both directions. Initially, "source" is the seed unit.

Whenever a configuration (abstraction, source) reaches the return-flow function, we proceed as follows:
- if "the other" analysis has already reached the return-flow function for "source"
	then we continue and at the same time unpause "the other" return flow 
- if "the other" analysis has not yet reached the return-flow function for "source" but is still propagating "source"
	then we register and pause the return flow and yield

On every propagation:
- if "the other" analysis has terminated the analysis for "source" then we kill the taint
